Title:VIRTUAL MOUSE USING HAND AND EYE MOVEMENTS 
Description:
A virtual mouse system utilizing hand and eye movements combines gesture recognition with eye-tracking technology to control the cursor on a computer screen.
Hand movements are detected using either a camera or sensor to track the user's hand gestures, allowing them to move the cursor across the screen, click, drag, and perform other actions by mimicking physical mouse movements.
Eye movements, tracked by an eye-tracking device, provide additional precision and control, enabling users to hover over specific elements on the screen or execute commands with a glance.
